# AI-Chatbot
## Introduction
This project implements a conversational AI chatbot that understands user messages, classifies their intent using NLP + Machine Learning, and returns appropriate responses based on a predefined knowledge base. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and extendable.
## Architecture Overview
The project integrates several technologies to deliver an end-to-end conversational AI system:
Python – Core programming language for building the chatbot.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)/spaCy – For preprocessing and understanding user text.

Deep Learning Models (TensorFlow/PyTorch) – To power intent classification and response generation.

Flask – To serve the chatbot as a web application.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript – For a simple interactive UI.
