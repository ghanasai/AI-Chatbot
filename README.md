# AI-Chatbot

## Introduction
This project implements an intelligent chatbot capable of responding to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversation, offering a scalable solution for customer support, information retrieval, or educational assistance.

---

## Architecture Overview
The project integrates several technologies to deliver an end-to-end conversational AI system:

- **Python** – Core programming language for building the chatbot.  
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) / spaCy** – For preprocessing and understanding user text.  
- **Deep Learning Models (TensorFlow / PyTorch)** – To power intent classification and response generation.  
- **Flask** – To serve the chatbot as a web application.  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – For a simple interactive UI.  

### Architecture Flow
1. User interacts with the chatbot through a web interface.  
2. User text is preprocessed (tokenization, stemming / lemmatization, stop-word removal).  
3. Intent classification model predicts the category of the query.  
4. The chatbot retrieves or generates the appropriate response.  
5. Response is displayed back to the user in the chat interface.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Source** – Predefined intents JSON file containing patterns and responses.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Text is cleaned, tokenized, and converted into numerical form (Bag of Words / TF-IDF / Embeddings).  
3. **Model Training** – A neural network is trained to classify intents.  
4. **Response Generation** – Based on predicted intent, a matching response is returned.  
5. **Deployment** – The chatbot is deployed via Flask for web-based interaction.

## Dataset
The project uses a custom intents dataset (in JSON format) that defines:

- **Intents** – Categories of user queries (e.g., greetings, farewells, FAQs).  
- **Patterns** – Example user inputs for each intent.  
- **Responses** – Possible chatbot replies.

---

## Key Steps
- **Data Preparation** – Build intents dataset with patterns and responses.  
- **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.  
- **Model Training** – Train an NLP / ML model for intent classification.  
- **Chatbot Engine** – Develop logic to map classified intent to responses.  
- **Web Integration** – Use Flask + HTML / CSS / JS for the frontend chat interface.

---

## Insights
- **User Engagement** – The chatbot provides real-time automated responses.  
- **Intent Accuracy** – With proper training, the intent classifier achieves high accuracy in understanding queries.  
- **Scalability** – The system can be extended with APIs (e.g., weather, news, knowledge base).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Framework**: Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Future Work
- Improve chatbot accuracy using transformer models (BERT / GPT).  
- Add voice recognition (speech-to-text) support.  
- Integrate with messaging platforms (Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram).  
- Add a knowledge base retrieval system for FAQ automation.
